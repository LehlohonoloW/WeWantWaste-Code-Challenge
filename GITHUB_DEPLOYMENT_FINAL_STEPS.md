# Final Steps to Deploy Your React Project to GitHub

## Your Git Setup is Complete! ✅
- Git is configured with your name: LehlohonoloW
- Git is configured with your email: sadjiim.673dc@gmail.com
- Your project is committed locally (commit: dc12601)

## Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository and Push

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the green "New" button (or "+" in top right → "New repository")
3. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `Code-challenge-react-webpage-redesign`
   - **Description**: `Professional React redesign demonstrating modern web development practices, responsive design, and user-centered UI/UX`
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (so your employer can see it)
   - **Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license** (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. You'll need to run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Code-challenge-react-webpage-redesign.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username**

### Step 3: Commands to Run in Your Terminal
Once you have the GitHub repository URL, run these commands:

1. **Add the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Code-challenge-react-webpage-redesign.git
   ```

2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 4: Optional - Set Up GitHub Pages for Live Demo
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" in left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

Your live site will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Code-challenge-react-webpage-redesign`

## What Your Employer Will See:
✅ Professional README with comprehensive project documentation
✅ Complete React source code with modern architecture
✅ Performance-optimized build files
✅ Clean commit history showing your development process
✅ Live demo (if you set up GitHub Pages)
